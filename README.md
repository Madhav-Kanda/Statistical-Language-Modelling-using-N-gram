# Statistical-Language-Modelling-using-N-gram
Using Natural Language Processing, the model predicts the most
probable next word and outputs the correctness of an input English
sentence.To achieve the optimum accuracy, a largereliable dataset
or corpus is extracted from Wikipedia, preprocessed, and then
analyzed before using it to train the model. 

Analyzing the dataset and its visualization can be an insightful technique to understand
the corpus before using it for the model's training. Choosing an appropriate model for any problem is a crucial step. In our case,
using a trigram model to train the data proved to be the best
trade-of .This trained model is finally used in the code to predict the
next word and find the perplexity of a given sentence based on the
trigram model
